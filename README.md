# Hermes
Hermes is a Django application that provides simple text board functionality Ã  la 2ch

## A text board?
Think 4chan without the pictures.

## Why?
The internet was down and I was watching a lot of Densha Otoko.

# Usage
Hermes is a Django application, but not a project in itself. To use Hermes, you will need to install Django normally
and include some pre-requisites. The relevant parts of the parent project's requirements.txt are as follows:

    Django==1.7.4
    django-bootstrap3==5.1.1

Make sure you include 'hermes' and 'bootstrap3' in your settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS list. You'll need to set up the urls.py
too, but it should be no different from adding any other application to your project.

## Database
Hermes uses the standard Django model stuff, so it will happily attempt to use the database you specify in the project proper.

## django-bootstrap3
This project uses django-bootstrap3 to streamline development. It's pretty cool, you should check it out!
If you want your project to look just like the demo Hermes instance, you'll need this in your settings.py:

    BOOTSTRAP3 = {}
    BOOTSTRAP3['horizontal_label_class'] = 'col-xs-4 col-md-4'
    BOOTSTRAP3['horizontal_field_class'] = 'col-xs-8 col-md-8'
    BOOTSTRAP3['set_placeholder'] = False

# Work in Progress
Hermes is a functionally simple application, so the remaining work includes stuff like:
* Finishing the primary functionality (right now the user interface isn't finished)
* Making it look good (this is the hard part)
* Adding features for 'user management' (read: IP bans)
* Moderation interface for deleting posts, threads, etc.
